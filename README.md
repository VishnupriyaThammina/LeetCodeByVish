I realize the fact that its too late to start DSA practice now but its never too late when we are actually willing to put your heart and soul into whatever you are willing to do. I am giving myself a span of 6 months to get better at everything so I am putting this out there. either this will be an epic failure or a life changing momenta of serene wonderous first step of my journey, thankyou
